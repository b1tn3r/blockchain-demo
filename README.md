# Blockchain Demo

Simple Blockchain demo using a proof of work algorithm for adding new blocks to the blockchain. This is a basic usage of blockchain using crypto.js for SHA256 hashing and in depth notes that allow you to follow along with the code that runs the blockchain and gives output in the console showing validated blocks and invalid blocks when run in a usage case.

If you're new to blockchain, this is essentially the bare structure for a chain in one main.js file that makes it easy to understand.
